           <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I am a masters student from Clones in Co. Monaghan. After graduating from my bachelors degree in English and Human Development, I worked as a digital marketing assistant and studied multimedia production part-time where I was introduced to Interaction Design. During this time, I learnt about graphic design, photo editing, video production and web design.</p>
            <p>This porfolio is a display of some of the work I have completed so far at the University of Limerick and also includes other graphic design work that I have done outside of college.</p>

            <h3><p>Photography</p></h3>
            <p>One of our first assignments was to take photos that all had a similar theme of 'LIfe'. I took these photos around Limerick using a DSLR camera, I adjusted the settings on the camera to to fit the lighting of where I was taking the photo and then edited the photos in Photoshop. I learnt how to take and photos during this assignment. I learnt a lot from editing the photos as I had never edited photos in Photoshop before, it was interesting to find out different tricks such as the Conent Aware feature and leveling photos.</p>

                <h3><p>Sound Editing</p></h3>
            <p>I created a sound story during the first semester using sound effects and clips in Audacity. I used the theme of Halloween for my story. I learnt how to use Audacity and different effects audio can have. I felt that this was a fun assignment and made me think more about audio and sound effects.</p>

                <h3><p>Video Making and Editing</p></h3>
            <p>For a video assignment, I worked in a group to create an advertisement for a portable speaker. This included shooting videos the and editing the clips together to create the final video. We used a camera, props and a greenscreen to help us get the video clips we needed and then edited the video in AfterEffects and PremierePro to get the final result. In this assignment, I definitley enjoyed working as part of a team and the whole process from coming up with ideas for the story board to editing the footage in After Effects, which I had never used. </p>

                <h3><p>3D Modelling and Animation</p></h3>
            <p>During a 3D Digital Modelling module, we created digital 3D models and animated them to create a video animation. I created a kitchen scene that shows a cup of tea being made. I used Maya to make the models and animate the scene and used PremerePro to edit the video. I found this module hard as I had never used Maya before this but after this module, I was happy with the outcome and all I had learned.</p>
